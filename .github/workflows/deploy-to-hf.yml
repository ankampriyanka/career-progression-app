## 6️⃣ Optional: GitHub Actions – `.github/workflows/deploy-to-hf.yml`

Use this only if you want **CI/CD from GitHub to an existing Space**.  
(You’ll need a secret `HF_TOKEN` with write access to your HF account.)

```yaml
name: Deploy to Hugging Face Space

on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Push to Hugging Face Hub
        uses: huggingface/hub-actions@v1
        with:
          repo-token: ${{ secrets.TEAMCAREERPROGRESSIONAPPTOKEN }}
          repo-id: Priyanka-Ankam/Team-Career-Progression-App   # <-- change to your Space ID
